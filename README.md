# Criminal DNA Profiling and Data Management

This is a console based application which uses C++ to implement a criminal record management system. We have used various data structures to manage the records such as: singly linked lists and binary search trees. We have also used linear searching and insertion sort to display the data.
The criminal profiling system uses the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch Algorithm (Global Alignment Algorithm) to match DNA for identification. The data is stored in a text file using C++ filing.
